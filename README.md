# READMEGenerator

## Description

This application utilizes Node.js and the Inquirer package to prompt the user with questions about their project. Once all of the prompts are moved through, it will generate a file called generatedREADME.md in the directory. This file will contain the user's answers to the prompts in an already formatted README file.

## Usage

This application runs in the terminal so users will have to download the repository. It also requires users to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Once a user has installed Node, navigate to a terminal within the directory of the application. Install the Inquirer package by running the following command in the terminal: `npm install inquirer`.`

Once the Inquirer package is installed, run the application by running the following command in the terminal: `node index.js`. The application will give users a number of prompts in sequential order. Once all of the prompts are answered, the application will generate a file called `generatedREADME.md` in the directory. This file will contain the user's answers to the prompts in an already formatted README file. 

Note: `README.md` is the file that contains the code for this README file and is not pertient to the user. `generatedREADME.md` is the file that is generated by the application with the answered prompts.

Users can access the deployed GitHub pages site and browse through the different pages. The navbar at the top hosts the links to each page.
